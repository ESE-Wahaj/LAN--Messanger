# LAN--Messanger
It is a local LAN chatting and file sharing ability over LAN. This is helpful when there is no internet access in our connection, but we can still communicate over the network.

Local LAN Messaging System (Server)

Introduction:
-----------------
This is a simple local LAN messaging system server built for the Windows operating system using C++ and Winsock. The server allows clients to connect over the network and exchange messages.

Features:
-----------------
- Accepts client connections over the network
- Handles multiple client connections concurrently using threads
- Receives messages from clients and echoes them back

Requirements:
-----------------
- Windows operating system
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW, Visual Studio)
- CLion IDE (optional)

Getting Started:
-----------------
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.(For GitHub Users)
2. Open the project in CLion or your preferred C++ development environment.(For forks with source code)

Building and Running:
-----------------
1. Build the project to compile the source code.
   - In CLion: Click on the "Build" menu and choose "Build Project".
   - Using a command line compiler: Navigate to the project directory and run the appropriate build command (e.g., `g++ server.cpp -o server`).
2. Run the server executable generated by the build process.
   - In CLion: Click on the "Run" menu and choose "Run 'server'".
   - Using a command line: Execute the generated server executable (e.g., `./server`).

Usage:
-----------------
1. Launch the server application.
   - The server will start listening for client connections on port 54000.
2. Clients can connect to the server using the server's IP address and port 54000.
   - Clients should have the client-side application running and enter the server's IP address when prompted.

Server Operation:
-----------------
- Once the server is running, it will display a message indicating that it is waiting for connections.
- Clients can connect to the server by entering the server's IP address in their client-side application.
- The server will handle multiple client connections concurrently using threads.
- Messages received from clients will be displayed on the server's console.
- The server will echo the received messages back to the respective clients.

Closing the Server:
-----------------
- To stop the server, you can simply terminate the server application by pressing Ctrl+C or closing the console window.
- The server will close all client connections and release the network resources.
