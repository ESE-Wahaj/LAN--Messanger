- CLion IDE (optional)

Getting Started:
-----------------
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.(For GitHub Users)
2. Open the project in CLion or your preferred C++ development environment.(For forks with source code)

Building and Running:
-----------------
1. Build the project to compile the source code.
   - In CLion: Click on the "Build" menu and choose "Build Project".
   - Using a command line compiler: Navigate to the project directory and run the appropriate build command (e.g., `g++ server.cpp -o server`).
2. Run the server executable generated by the build process.
   - In CLion: Click on the "Run" menu and choose "Run 'server'".
   - Using a command line: Execute the generated server executable (e.g., `./server`).

Usage:
-----------------
1. Launch the server application.
   - The server will start listening for client connections on port 54000.
2. Clients can connect to the server using the server's IP address and port 54000.
   - Clients should have the client-side application running and enter the server's IP address when prompted.

Server Operation:
-----------------
- Once the server is running, it will display a message indicating that it is waiting for connections.
- Clients can connect to the server by entering the server's IP address in their client-side application.
- The server will handle multiple client connections concurrently using threads.
- Messages received from clients will be displayed on the server's console.
- The server will echo the received messages back to the respective clients.
